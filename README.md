# Disaster-Response-Project
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data science nanodegree. This project transformed data and loaded it into a sqlite3 database, then created a model which trained with cross validation in pipelines to aviod data leakage and finally shows results on a webapp. This project demonstrates skills in data engineering, machine learning and software development.
